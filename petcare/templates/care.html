    <h1 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000"> As a pet parent you want to do everything you can to care for your pet; this involves
      regular, everyday activities to ensure they stay happy and healthy. Practice these ten responsible pet care tips
      year after year for a lifetime of happy and healthy cats and dogs.</h1>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">1. Veterinarian Visits</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. Given their
      shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or cat should be getting a checkup at least once or twice a year. Depending
      on your pet's vaccination schedule, they may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing and
      maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.</p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Trips to the vet can be, shall we say, challenging. Cats, in particular, may be averse to
      leaving the comfy confines of their home, but there are ways to reduce stress for both of you. Acclimating your
      cat to her carrier when she is a kitten is good practice (and avoids the running-away-and-hiding-under-the-bed
      scenario). Dogs tend to like going for car rides. Take your pup on joyrides, so he won't associate getting into
      the car with going to the vet. And many pets don't mind a trip to the veterinarian's office, especially if you
      choose a vet that's a good fit for your little friend.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">2. Vaccinations</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care. Soon after welcoming
      your new pet into your home, schedule an immunization appointment. During your first visit, the vet will set up an
      immunization schedule for your little pup or kitten to protect them from illness and disease. Vaccinations for
      puppies should happen early in your puppies first few weeks after you bring him home. Talk to your vet at your
      first appointment, on when a good time to schedule that visit. They help prevent diseases such as rabies, Lyme
      disease, and distemper. Cats benefit from vaccines that prevent feline herpes virus, feline leukemia, and rabies.
      If you've adopted an adult or senior animal, make sure they are immunized, too. Vaccinations do need renewal and
      aren't just for young pets.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">3. Proper Identification</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">If the unthinkable happens and your little guy or gal gets lost — youngsters in
      particular are prone to dashing out the door — having proper identification is the key to a happy ending. Start
      with the basics: a safe collar, and a tag that contains all of your contact information. In addition to an ID tag,
      microchipping your pet is advisable, because there's always the chance a collar will fall off. The microchip, an
      electronic device about the size and shape of a grain of rice, is implanted under your pet's skin and can be read
      by a scanner that pulls up your identification information. A combination of these forms of identification will go
      a long way to reuniting you and your beloved pet, but only if you keep your contact information up-to-date. Be
      sure to change your information on file with the microchip if you have a change in address or phone number.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">4. Spaying/Neutering</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Sterilizing your pet prevents a host of health problems, including complicated
      pregnancies, and reduces the number of homeless animals. Spaying your kitty (removing the uterus and ovaries)
      greatly reduces her risk for cervical cancer, eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer, and prevents her from going
      into "heat." That minimizes the chance that she'll stray from home in search of a partner, and any nearby male
      cats will be less aggressive (and they won't spray to mark their territory, something that benefits you and your
      furniture). Neutering your puppy helps alleviate aggression and roaming the neighborhood, and will prevent him
      from getting testicular cancer. Because spaying or neutering is surgery that requires general anesthesia, your pet
      will likely stay overnight at the vet's office for at least one night for observation and recuperation.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">5. Healthy Food</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Two connected elements of responsible pet ownership include providing animals with fresh,
      cool water and healthy food at all times. The right pet food will enrich your best buddy's life, providing them
      with the energy and nutrients they need. With so many meal options to choose from, it can be daunting, but you can
      become adept in no time by familiarizing yourself with important ingredients and how they help your pup or kitty.
      When choosing the best cat food, look for a good balance of protein, carbs and fats. These are important
      ingredients for dog food, too, as is plenty of fiber for the digestive system. In addition to healthy ingredients,
      select a pet food formula that is appropriate for your pet's age, health conditions and activity level, and speak
      to your vet before switching your pet to a specialized food.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">6. At-Home Care</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">As your pets' caretaker, your job is to provide them with good hygiene habits at home as
      well as at the vet's or groomer's. Brushing their teeth, combing their coats and providing them with healthy food
      all keeps them in tip-top shape. To stay on track with responsible pet care, schedule hygiene and grooming tasks
      in your calendar and try combining tasks, such as a comforting comb after trimming nails, until it becomes
      routine.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">7. Comfy Quarters</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">As the seasons change or you rearrange your living space, take a look around to see that
      you're providing your pet with a safe, cozy habitat. Dog bed looking a little flat? Buy your pup a new one. Litter
      box area not cutting it anymore? Spruce up your kitty's bathroom with a new box and scoop. This also is a good
      time to check for potential hazards. Look for exposed cords or wires (young animals find these to be great chew
      toys), secure safety gates, repair loose windows or screens and remove any plants that are poisonous to your pet.
    </p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">8. Training and Socializing</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">One of the most important aspects of responsible pet care is ensuring your dog or cat is
      well-trained, and proper socializing is a part of that. Starting when they're young is best and most effective,
      but it's never too late to learn new tricks. Toilet training is the number one priority for any animal with whom
      you share your home, as is working on obedience training. Learning socialization skills will help your puppy or
      kitten bond with you and with other pets. Ask your vet or local animal shelter for recommendations for good
      trainers in your area or at-home training guides to read. A well-trained pet is a happy pet, and that translates
      to a happy pet parent.</p>


    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">9. Following Dog Park Rules</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Taking your dog outside to play is one heck of a good time, and, being the social
      creatures they are, dogs love a good romp outdoors. If you decide to take your pup to a dog park, abide by the
      posted rules. Proper dog park etiquette, such as bringing your own toys and not bringing in food, keeps everyone
      safe, especially if a dog is aggressive or under-socialized. Bring along treats for afterward to reward your guy
      for his good behavior. Vets also recommend that you wait until your dog is at least four months old before
      bringing him to the dog park to ensure he's vaccinated before being exposed to other animals.</p>

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">10. Safe Playtime</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">It's no secret that dogs and cats love to play, and it's an effective
      relationship-building activity. Take stock of their toys. Are they safe? Be mindful of threadbare stuffed toys
      that pose choking hazards and hard, sharp edges that could cause injury. Throw away and replace playthings that
      are worn out. Making DIY cat toys and dog toys is a great, inexpensive way to bring even more fun to pet
      parenting!</p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Remember, these tips aren't applicable just during pet holidays — make them part of your
      regular pet parenting role, and you and your pets will reap the benefits for a lifetime!</p>
